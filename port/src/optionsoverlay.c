/*
 * F10 in-game options overlay -- approach (C) from docs/dev/OPTIONS-MENU-PLAN.md.
 *
 * Port-layer only. No src/ menu code is touched: the overlay draws its own
 * fast3d 2D display list (appended after the game DL in gfx_run) and edits the
 * port-owned config.c variables directly. Live knobs apply immediately; the
 * two that need an FBO/window rebuild (MSAA, Fullscreen) are tagged "(restart)".
 *
 * The panel adapts to whatever 2D space it is drawn in (320x240 in-game vs
 * 440x330 on front-end screens -- viSetXY differs) and scrolls when the row
 * list outgrows the viewport (wheel / arrows at the edges). Cyclic rows
 * (MSAA, texture filter, resolution, toggles) wrap in both directions; the
 * manual % rows (draw/LOD distance) are hidden while their "auto" toggle is on.
 *
 * Text + fill helpers are the game's own (textRender / microcode_constructor /
 * gDPFillRectangle) reached by extern -- same pattern input.c uses to read
 * current_menu / cursor_h_pos. This is a rendering/UI view, not a logic change.
 *
 * Diagnostic: set GE_OPTIONSOVERLAY=1 to auto-open at boot (headless layout
 * check). Env-gated, harmless when unset.
